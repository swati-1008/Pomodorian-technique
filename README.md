# Pomodorian-technique

Intermediate Python-Tkinter GUI implementation of the popular Pomodorian technique of time management.

It runs a timer of 25 mins for work, after which 5 mins of short break shall be taken. After 4 such cycles, a long break of 20 minutes shall be given to the user. The program then restarts 25 mins of work and so on.

In the GUI, green shows Work time, Pink shows short break, and Red shows long break.


Concepts like DYNAMIC TYPING, CANVAS WIDGETS, etc are used in the implementation.
